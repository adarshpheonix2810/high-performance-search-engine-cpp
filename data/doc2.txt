Basics of Machine Learning

Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems 
that learn from data instead of being explicitly programmed. A machine learning model is trained 
on a dataset and then used to make predictions or decisions.

Search engines also use machine learning techniques. For example, they can learn which documents 
are more relevant to a query based on user clicks, query logs and historical data.

Common algorithms in machine learning include linear regression, decision trees, neural networks 
and clustering methods. Performance, generalization and scalability are important concepts 
in modern machine learning systems.
