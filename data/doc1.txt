Introduction to Search Engines

A search engine is a software system that helps users find information on the internet. 
It crawls web pages, stores them as documents and builds an index over the text.

When a user types a query, the search engine computes a relevance score for each document 
using ranking algorithms like TF-IDF or BM25. The most relevant documents are returned as results.

Modern search engines focus on speed, scalability and high performance. They use caching, 
inverted indexes, parallel processing and distributed systems to handle millions of queries per second.
