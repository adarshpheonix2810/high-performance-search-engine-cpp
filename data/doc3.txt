High Performance Systems with C++

C++ is a powerful programming language that allows fine-grained control over memory, performance 
and system resources. It is widely used to build high performance systems such as game engines, 
databases, trading platforms and search engines.

A high performance search engine written in C++ can use multithreading, efficient data structures 
and low-level optimizations. Techniques like caching, memory pools and lock-free programming 
can significantly reduce latency.

Developers often combine C++ with modern tools like CMake, unit testing frameworks and profiling tools 
to build reliable and scalable software systems.
